Group Project - Sydney Livability Score

The goal of this project was to compute the Sydney Livabiltiy Score and suggest a suitable place for a young single stakeholder, 
in their late twenties, who is looking to work full-time in Sydney.

Data Sources: 
The liveability scores were computed using 7 different datasets from 4 different sources, which were then
stored in a database. The ’BusinessStats.csv’, ’Neighbourhoods.csv’ and ’SA2 2016 AUST.zip’ datasets
were from the ABS census data. The ’break and enter.zip’ dataset was from the NSW Bureau of Crime
Statistics and Research (BOCSAR), and ’school catchments.zip’ were from NSW Department of Education.
Additional datasets, ’swimming pools’ and ’bicycle parking’, were sourced from the City of Sydney
Open Data Hub.
